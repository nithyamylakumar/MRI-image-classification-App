## Overview
This Streamlit app allows the user to interact with the saved model file and view the predicted classification for the test images. It has the capability to classify different types of tumor images such as glioma, meningioma, no-tumor, and pituitary tumor.

## Future Work
In the future, the app can be further improved by adding an option to upload the user's own image. Additionally, the resulting segmentation of the tumor can also be included in the app to enhance its functionality.

To run the app, first install the required packages by running the following command:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Then run the app using:
streamlit run app.py
